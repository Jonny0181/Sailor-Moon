# Todo List

## 1. Language Support
- [] Externalize all text and messages into language files.
- [x] Implement a command to switch the bot's language.
- [] Maybe try adding auto-detection based on user preferences. (Could maybe get the guilds )

## 2. Application Commands
- [] Add a context command to view the users listening stats.

## Website
- [] Finish spotify container, make it look more proffesional and input the users information
- [] Make the spotify disconnect button functional.
- [] Add more information about the users connected spotify account. (Email, Liked songs number, number of playlists)
- [] Have the disconnect and open spotify buttons match and be on top of each other.
- [] Add a container when viewing a collaborative playlists that allows you to view and manage authorized users. (view done)
- [x] Allow users to select one of their playlists from a list and view all of the songs in it and delete ones they want to.
     when viewing a playlist it should show the album cover, single title and artist (like spotify)
- [] Add Liked songs to main nav bar so they can view and manage liked songs
- [] Implement a way for users to be able to manage server settings of the bot in the dashboard
     maybe have a navbar up top for user settings, and guild setting
- [] when listing songs of playlist, create a nav bar with options current songs and recommendations.
     song recomendations must contain "Add Song" button to add the song to the playlist.
- [] Update dashboard theme to match the rest of the website.
